Display a custom field as a block on the frontend. Supports custom fields for posts, terms, and users. Officially supports ACF, Meta Box.

== Description ==

This single-block plugin allows you to display a meta field or a custom field as a block on the front end. It supports custom fields for posts, terms, and users. It can be nested inside a parent block that has `postId` and `postType` context, such as `Query Block`, `WooCommerce Product Collection`, or used as a stand-alone block.

You can display any field whose value can be retrieved by the core API ([get_post_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_meta/), [get_term_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_term_meta/), [get_user_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_user_meta/)) and is a string or can be converted to a string. To display the field value in the Block Editor, it has to be accessible via the REST API or have the field type set to `dynamic`.

You can also display custom fields created by the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) or [Meta Box](https://metabox.io/) plugin  explicitly. It supports all [ACF field types](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/#field-types) and [Meta Box field types](https://docs.metabox.io/fields) whose values are strings or can be converted to strings. Some other ACF complex fields such as Image, Link, Page Link, True False, Checkbox, Select, Radio, Button Group, Taxonomy, User, Post Object and Relationship field types as well as Meta Box fields such as Select, Checkbox, Radio, Image, Video, Taxonomy, User, Post field types are also supported in basic formats.

This plugin also provides developer-friendly hook APIs that allow you to easily customize the output of the block, display complex data type fields, or use the block as a placeholder to display any kind of content with `object_id` and `object_type` as context parameters.

An edge case where this block is really helpful is when you need to get the correct `post_id` in your shortcode when you use it in a Query Loop. In that case, you can set the field type as `dynamic` and input your shortcode in the field name. The block will display it correctly on both the front end and the editor. Alternatively, if you only want to see the preview of your shortcode in the editor, you can also use this block as a better version of the `core/shortcode`.

= What is the HTML output of a custom field? =

The HTML output of a custom field on the front end depends on the context of the field. It uses one of these core API functions to get the field value: [get_post_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_meta/), [get_term_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_term_meta/), [get_user_meta](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_user_meta/).

= What is the HTML output of ACF fields? =

1. All basic field types that return strings or can cast to strings are supported - The HTML output is from the `get_field` function.

2. Link type - The HTML output is:

        <a href={url} target={target} rel="noreferrer noopener">{title}</a>

    There is no `rel` attribute if the `target` is not `_blank`

3. Image type - The HTML output is from the [wp_get_attachment_image](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_attachment_image/) function. The image size is from the Preview Size setting.

4. True / False type - The HTML output is `Yes` if the value is `true`, and `No` if the value is `false`. Below is the code snippet to change these text values:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_true_false_on_text', function ( $on_text, $field_name, $field, $post_id, $value ) {
          return 'Yep';
        }, 10, 5 );

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_true_false_off_text', function ( $off_text, $field_name, $field, $post_id, $value ) {
          return 'Noop';
        }, 10, 5 );

5. Checkbox / Select type - The HTML output is:

        <span class="value-item">{item_value}</span>, <span class="value-item">{item_value}</span>

    The `item_value` can be either `value` or `label`, depending on the return format of the field. Multiple selected values are separated by `, `. Below is the code snippet to change the separator:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_acf_field_choice_item_separator', function ( $separator, $field_name, $field, $post_id, $value ) {
          return ' | ';
        }, 10, 5 );

6. Radio button / Button group type - The HTML output can be either `value` or `label`, depending on the return format of the field.

7. Page link type, Post object type - The HTML output for a single-value field is:

        <a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a>

    For a multiple-value field is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
        </ul>

8. Relationship type - The HTML output is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
        </ul>

9. Taxonomy type - The HTML output is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="term-link" href={term_url}>{term_name}</a></li>
          <li><a class="term-link" href={term_url}>{term_name}</a></li>
        </ul>

10. User type - The HTML output for a single-value field is:

        <a class="user-link" href={author_url}>{display_name}</a>

    For a multiple-value field is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="user-link" href={author_url}>{display_name}</a></li>
          <li><a class="user-link" href={author_url}>{display_name}</a></li>
        </ul>

11. For other complex field types, you can generate a custom HTML output by using the hook:

        apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', $field_value, $post_id, $field, $raw_value, $object_type )

    Or by using the general hook:

        apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', $content, $attributes, $block, $object_id, $object_type )

= What is the HTML output of Meta Box fields? =

1. Similar to ACF fields, all basic fields that return strings or can cast to strings using the function `rwmb_get_value` are supported.

    The HTML output of cloneable basic fields is:

        <span class="value-repeater-item">{item_1_value}</span>, <span class="value-repeater-item">{item_2_value}</span>

    Use the following hooks to change the tag and the separator:

        apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_mb_clone_field_item_separator', ', ', $field, $post_id, $field_value )
        apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_mb_clone_field_item_tag', 'span', $field, $post_id, $field_value )

2. Single image types - The HTML output is from the [wp_get_attachment_image](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_attachment_image/) function. The image size is from the `image_size` setting.

3. Image list types (Image, Image advanced, Image upload) - The HTML output is:

        <figure class="image-list">
          <figure class="image-item"><img /></figure>
          <figure class="image-item"><img /></figure>
        </figure>

4. Checkbox / Switch type - Similar to ACF True / False type.

5. Multi-choice types (Select, Select advanced, Button group, Autocomplete, Image select, Checkbox list) - The HTML output is:

        <span class="value-item">{item_value}</span>, <span class="value-item">{item_value}</span>

    To display the label instead of the value, use this hook:

        apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_mb_field_choice_item_display_label', false, $field_name, $field, $post_id, $value )

    To change the separator, use this hook:

        apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_mb_field_choice_item_separator', ', ', $file_name, $field, $post_id, $value )

6. Radio type - The output is the field value by default. To display label or change the separator, use the same hooks as the multi-choice types.

7. Post type - The HTML output for a single-value field is:

        <a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a>

    For a multiple-value field is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
          <li><a class="post-link" href={url} rel="bookmark">{title}</a></li>
        </ul>

8. Taxonomy, Taxonomy advanced type - The HTML output for a single-value field is:

        <a class="term-link" href={term_url}>{term_name}</a>

    For a multiple-value field is:

        <ul>
          <li><a class="term-link" href={term_url}>{term_name}</a></li>
          <li><a class="term-link" href={term_url}>{term_name}</a></li>
        </ul>

9. User type - Similar to ACF User type

10. Video type - The HTML output for a single-value field is:

        <video controls preload="metadata" src={video_src} width={video_width} poster={poster} />

    For a multiple-value field is:

        <figure class="video-list">
          <figure class="video-item"><video /></figure>
          <figure class="video-item"><video /></figure>
        </figure>

11. To display complex field types or change the output of a field, use the hook `meta_field_block_get_mb_field` or the general hook `meta_field_block_get_block_content`.

= Copy & paste snippets =

When using the `meta_field_block_get_block_content` hook to customize block content, we recommend selecting `dynamic` as the field type. This way, both the front end and the editor will show the changes. If you are working with ACF Fields, we suggest using the `meta_field_block_get_acf_field` hook to modify the field content. Similarly, Meta Box users should use the `meta_field_block_get_mb_field` hook to modify the content. ACF snippets can also be used with Meta Box fields, but you must use the correct hook name and replace the `get_field` function with the `rwmb_get_value` function.

1. How to change the HTML output of the block?
    Using the `meta_field_block_get_block_content` hook:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id, $object_type ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_unique_field_name' === $field_name ) {
            $block_content = 'new content';
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 5);

    Using the `meta_field_block_get_acf_field` hook for ACF Fields only:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', function ( $block_content, $post_id, $field, $raw_value, $object_type ) {
          $field_name = $field['name'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_unique_field_name' === $field_name ) {
            $block_content = 'new content';
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 5);

    This basic snippet is very powerful. You can use it to display any fields from any posts, terms, users or setting fields. Please see the details in the below use cases.

2. How to wrap the block with a link to the post within the Query Loop?
    Using the `meta_field_block_get_block_content` hook:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_unique_field_name' === $field_name && $block_content !== '' ) {
            $block_content = sprintf('<a href="%1$s">%2$s</a>', get_permalink($post_id), $block_content);
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

    Using the `meta_field_block_get_acf_field` hook for ACF Fields only:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', function ( $block_content, $post_id, $field, $raw_value ) {
          $field_name = $field['name'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_unique_field_name' === $field_name && $block_content !== '' ) {
            $block_content = sprintf('<a href="%1$s">%2$s</a>', get_permalink($post_id), $block_content);
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

    This snippet only works with the block that has only HTML inline tags or an image.

3. How to display an image URL field as an image tag?
    Using the `meta_field_block_get_block_content` hook:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_image_url_field_name' === $field_name && wp_http_validate_url($block_content) ) {
            $block_content = sprintf('<img src="%1$s" alt="your_image_url_field_name" />', esc_attr($block_content));
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

    Using the `meta_field_block_get_acf_field` hook for ACF Fields only:

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_acf_field', function ( $block_content, $post_id, $field, $raw_value ) {
          $field_name = $field['name'] ?? '';

          if ( 'your_image_url_field_name' === $field_name && wp_http_validate_url($block_content) ) {
            $block_content = sprintf('<img src="%1$s" alt="your_image_url_field_name" />', esc_attr($block_content));
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

4. How to display multiple meta fields in a block?
    For example, we need to display the full name of a user from two meta fields `first_name` and `last_name`.

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          if ( 'full_name' === $field_name ) {
            $first_name = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'first_name', true );
            $last_name  = get_post_meta( $post_id, 'last_name', true );

            // If the meta fields are ACF Fields. The code will be:
            // $first_name = get_field( 'first_name', $post_id );
            // $last_name  = get_field( 'last_name', $post_id );

            $block_content = trim("$first_name $last_name");
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

    Choose the field type as `dynamic` and input the field name as `full_name`.

5. How to display a setting field?
    For example, we need to display a setting field named `footer_credit` on the footer template part of the site.

        add_filter( 'meta_field_block_get_block_content', function ( $block_content, $attributes, $block, $post_id ) {
          $field_name = $attributes['fieldName'] ?? '';

          // Replace `footer_credit` with your unique name.
          if ( 'footer_credit' === $field_name ) {
            $block_content = get_option( 'footer_credit', '' );

            // If the field is an ACF Field. The code will be:
            // $block_content = get_field( 'footer_credit', 'option' );
          }

          return $block_content;
        }, 10, 4);

6. [How to use MFB as a placeholder to display any kind of content?](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-use-mfb-to-display-dynamic-fields/)

= SAVE YOUR TIME WITH MFB PRO =

To display simple data type fields for posts, terms, and users, you only need the free version of MFB. MFB Pro can save you 90% of development time when working with ACF, or Meta Box complex fields. It achieves this by transforming your ACF complex field types into container blocks, which work similarly to core container blocks. This eliminates the need for creating custom blocks or writing custom code for displaying complex fields.

Below are some video tutorials that demonstrate how MFB Pro can help you display complex fields:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who needs this plugin? =

This plugin is created for developers, but end users can also use it.

= Does it support inputting and saving meta value? =

No, It does not. It only displays meta fields as blocks.

= Does it support all types of meta fields? =

Only simple types such as string, integer, or number can be used directly. Other complex types such as object, array need to be converted to HTML markup strings.

= Does it support all types of ACF fields? =

It supports all basic field types that return strings or cast to strings. Some complex field types like image, link, page_link, post_object, relationship, taxonomy, and user are also supported in a basic format. To display complex ACF field types such as Group, Repeater, Flexible Content, Gallery, File, etc., you will need to either purchase [MFB PRO](https://metafieldblock.com/pro?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=MFB%20Pro) or write your own custom code using the hook API.

= Does it support all types of Meta Box fields? =

It supports all basic field types and some complex field types such as Image, Video, Choice fields, Taxonomy, User, Post, in basic format. For other complex field types, you can use the built-in hook to display your fields with custom markup. [MFB PRO](https://metafieldblock.com/pro?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=MFB%20Pro) allows you displaying the Group field as a container block, Cloneable Group field as a repeater block with group, row, stack, grid, or carousel layout, Post field as a Query Loop, Image list fields as a gallery with grid or masonry layouts, or as a carousel of images.

= What are the prefix and suffix for? =

The value for those settings should be plain text or some allowed HTML elements. Their values will be formatted with `wp_kses( $prefix, wp_kses_allowed_html( "post" ) )`. They're helpful for some use cases like displaying the name of the meta field or a value with a prefix or suffix, e.g. $100, 100px, etc.

= Does it include some style for the meta field? =

The block does not provide any CSS style for the meta field value. But it does provide a basic display inline style from the settings.

= Does it support other meta-field frameworks? =

Yes, it does, as long as those meta fields can be accessed via the `get_post_meta`, or `get_term_meta`, or `get_user_meta` function and the return value is a string or can be cast to a string. To display the value in the block editor, the meta field has to be accessed via the REST API.

= What if the displayed markup is blank or is different from the meta value?

There is a chance that your meta value contains some HTML tags or HTML attributes that are not allowed to be displayed. To fix this, you should use the hook `apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_kses_allowed_html', $allowed_html_tags )` to add your tags and attributes to the array of allowed tags. By default, the block allows all tags from the `$allowedposttags` value and basic attributes for `iframe` and `SVG` elements.

If you don't want to sanitize the content at all, use this hook `apply_filters( 'meta_field_block_kses_content', false, $attributes, $block, $post_id, $object_type, $content )`. However, we don't recommend doing it unless you have a good reason.
