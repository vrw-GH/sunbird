== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The popup does not appear on my website. How can I fix this? =
If your popup is not showing, it is often related to **caching** issues. To resolve this:

1. **Clear your browser cache** â€” Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) to reload without cache.
2. **Clear your WordPress cache** â€” If you are using caching plugins (like WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache), clear the cache from plugin settings.
3. **Purge server-side cache** â€” If your hosting provider uses additional caching (e.g., Cloudflare, SiteGround, Nginx cache), purge the cache from your hosting panel.
4. **Disable caching temporarily** â€” If the popup still does not appear, temporarily disable your caching plugin and test again.

= The popup is visible only to administrators, not regular visitors. Why? =
Check if **"Test Mode"** is enabled. When Test Mode is active, popups are visible only to administrators for testing purposes and hidden from public users.

= Can I change the position of the popup? =
Yes! You can easily choose between **9 placement options** to position your popup exactly where you want it to appear on the screen.

= Can I display popups only on specific pages or posts? =
Yes! Popup Box allows you to:
- **Show popups sitewide** (on all pages).
- **Assign popups** to specific pages, posts, or custom post types via the popup settings.

In the **Pro version**, you can also create **advanced display rules** based on post types, categories, tags, user roles, referrer URLs, and more.

= Can I use multiple popups at the same time? =
Absolutely! You can create and display **multiple popups** across your website. Each popup has its own settings and triggers.

= How do I use Popup Box on a multisite network? =
If you are running a WordPress multisite, **activate Popup Box individually** on each site where you want to use it. Do not activate it network-wide.

= Will Popup Box slow down my website? =
No. **Popup Box is lightweight and optimized for performance**, with no jQuery dependency, ensuring minimal impact on your site's speed.
