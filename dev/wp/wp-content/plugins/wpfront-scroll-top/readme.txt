== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. **What is the "Scroll to Top" button, and how does it work?**
The "Scroll to Top" button is a convenient navigation feature that appears on your website as users scroll down a page. With a single click, it allows them to effortlessly return to the top of the page with a smooth, animated scroll, significantly improving the user experience, especially on long-form content.

1. **Is the "Scroll to Top" button always visible?**
No. The button gracefully appears only after a user has scrolled down a certain distance on the page and disappears when they are at the top, ensuring it doesn't obstruct content unnecessarily. You can also configure an Auto-Hide feature to make it disappear after a few seconds of inactivity.

1. **Can I customize the design of the button?**
You can choose to use simple text, select from a wide range of Font Awesome icons, or upload your own custom image (PNG or SVG) to perfectly match your website's branding. You also have full control over its position, size, colors, and hover effects.

1. **Can the button link to something other than the top of the page?**
Besides scrolling to the top, you can configure the button to:
    * Link to an In-Page Element: Direct users to a specific section or HTML element (like an anchor point) anywhere on the current page.
    * Redirect to a Different URL: Use the button to send users to another page on your site or even an external website.

1. **Can I control where the button appears on my website?**
You can easily enable or disable the "Scroll to Top" button on specific pages, posts, or custom post types through the plugin's settings, giving you full flexibility over its visibility.

1. **Is the plugin accessible for all users?**
The plugin is built with proper ARIA labels and includes screen reader text, ensuring that users relying on assistive technologies can navigate your site effectively and experience the benefits of the button.
